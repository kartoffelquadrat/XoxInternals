## About

This code imitates server side core functionality of Xox (Tic Tac Toe). It is not a complete implementation of an operational game, but it provides entry points to imitate server data interactions.  
The following scenario / functionality is covered:

 * Multi / parallel game management
 * Creation / Reset of games
   * Custom player names
   * Custom player colours
 * Retrieval of current board state
 * Retrieval of current game state
   * Winner / longest line by player
   * Game over
 * Retrieval of all available actions for player
 * Selection and application of a valid action by player
 
## Documentation

 * For a full description of available functionality, read the [JavaDoc](https://m5c.github.io/XoxInternals/index.html)
 * The relevant functionality is exposed in [```XoxManagerImpl.java```](https://m5c.github.io/XoxInternals/eu/kartoffelquadrat/xoxinternals/controller/XoxManagerImpl.html).

## Usage

On execution, the game will simply print a listing of an intial test setup.

 2. Compile the project with maven. This provides you with a self contained ```jar``` in the ```target```folder:
